## BRIEF BIO

I am a python backend developer with a mechanical engineering background and hands-on experience at a robotics company, where I worked on projects that bridged hardware and software in impactful ways.

Over time, I’ve developed a solid foundation in backend development, with practical skills in database design, API development, and system integration. I also enjoy messing around with automation projects and am currently exploring cloud platforms to better understand scalable system design.

Having been involved across the software development lifecycle—from planning and design to testing and deployment—I value the importance of planning, architecture, testing  and how each phase affects the final user/developer experience.

At present, I’m taking a break to focus on renovating my family home and personal learning .Also offering passive technical support to a startup I was previously involved with. This downtime has ignited my enthusiasm for contributing to open-source projects.

## Why I am interested in OHN:

I had followed how Kerala tackled the COVID-19 pandemic and learning that the OHN played a role in that really impressed me..I’d be thrilled to contribute to a project that has real-world impact and aligns with my values, interests and knowledge base.
